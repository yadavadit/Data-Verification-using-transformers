# Data Extration and Verification using Transformers

## 📌 Introduction  
Data verification is essential to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of information. As data volumes grow, traditional manual methods become inefficient. This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automate and enhance the data verification process.

## 🤖 What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

LLMs are advanced machine learning models trained on vast amounts of textual data. They are capable of:

- Understanding and processing natural language
- Generating coherent text
- Performing sentiment and contextual analysis
- Supporting fact-checking and anomaly detection tasks

> These capabilities make LLMs well-suited for automating data verification.

## 🧠 LLM Components for Data Verification

| Component                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Language Understanding** | Interprets the meaning of text with semantic accuracy.                  |
| **Contextual Understanding**       | Resolves ambiguities and detects inconsistencies in context.          |
| **Fact-Checking**                  | Cross-validates information with external trusted sources.            |
| **Bias Detection**                 | Identifies and mitigates bias in datasets or generated content.       |

## 📝 Use Case: Enhancing Lecture Notes

This project highlights a practical application of LLMs—improving the quality of lecture notes for students.

### 🔡 Step 1: OCR for Text Recognition  
- Utilizes **Tesseract OCR** to convert handwritten or scanned notes into machine-readable text.
- This serves as the raw input for LLM-based enhancement.

### 🔄 Step 2: Text Enhancement with Transformers  
- Leverages Hugging Face’s `transformers` library (e.g., **BART**, **T5**) to:
  - Correct grammatical errors
  - Improve sentence coherence
  - Restructure content logically for better readability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Tesseract OCR** – Text extraction from images and handwritten content  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** – Language models for text generation and correction  
- **Python** – Core programming language for implementation  

---

## ✅ Outcomes

By combining **LLMs**, **OCR**, and **transformers**, this project delivers:

- Efficient and scalable data verification  
- Enhanced clarity of handwritten or unstructured notes  
- Improved study experience through high-quality content generation
